Usage
=====
Sorry if this isn't a fully detailed yet, I'm building it for a work project, 
but hopefully I will get back to documenting it a little more fully.  In the 
mean time here's some basics.

All references below are assuming you're using the sample.html file included in
the repository.  If you are using your own code please adjust your paths
accordingly.

Simplest Approach
-----------------
The plugin is setup to automatically initialize any select object with the class
'premiumSelect'.  This gives you an immediate path to initialization without 
having to do any actual javascript code.

1) Include the javascript and css files appropriately:

Remember to set your paths to match your environment.

<pre>
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;js/premium-select-0.1b.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/premium-select.css&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

2) Setup a select DOM object.

No special DOM structures are required, just setup your select list, and give
it the right class name, and voila, its ready to go:

<pre>

</pre>
